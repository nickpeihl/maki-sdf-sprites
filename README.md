# Maki SDF Icons in Mapbox-GL Demo

`npm i && npm start`

This demo shows how we can display SDF icons from the @elastic/maki spritesheet.

Icon placement, color, and size are randomly generated.

Based on code from [mapbox-gl-js internals](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/master/src/style/style.js#L229-L245)
